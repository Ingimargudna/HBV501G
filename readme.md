## 1. Vision and Scope Document for your project
- Required section for template
	+ sect. 1.5 (Vision statement; see slide 8)
	+ One other 1.x section of your choice (except 1.1; see slide slide 7/11)
	  * background, business opportunity, business objectives, success metrics, business risks, business assumptions and dependencies
	+ One other 2.x section of your choice (except 2.1; see slide 11)
		* Major features, Scope of initial release, Scope of subsequent releases Limitations and exclusions
- Aim: "convince an investor to fund your development project"

## 2. Use Case document (text-only, no UML diagrams)
- describe three core features of your system as use cases:
	+ Use Fully dressed format template on slides 25-26
	+ Include sections 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 13
- Describe at least 5 more use cases you have come up with in brief format

Fully dressed use cases:
- User creation and log-in

## 3. Project Plan
- List out what use cases will be completed in each of the upcoming phases
	+ use the techniques you learned in HBV401G for Effort Estimation and Prioritization
- Your progress will be measured against this plan at the end of each phase

## 4. Project skeleton
- one team member makes a project skeleton for Java Spring project
- Upload that project to Github and add members as contributors
- each member makes a very small code contribution (via a commit)
